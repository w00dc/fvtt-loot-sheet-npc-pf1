# Loot Sheet NPC Pathfinder1

This module adds an additional NPC sheet which can be used for loot containers such as chests. It also allows spells to be automatically converted into spell scrolls by dragging them onto this sheet. 

This version was forked from Jan Ole Peek's module which doesn't support pf1 system (https://github.com/jopeek/fvtt-loot-sheet-npc-5e). 
This fork will be maintained separately and specifically for Pathfinder 1 (may support PF2 in the future)

##### Permissions & split money

* Permissions can be set in the sheet for each player and range from no access (cannot open sheet) to observer (view sheet and contents) to owner (view sheet and add/remove items).
* Any coins in the sheet can easily be split evenly across all players with owner access. The math and distribution is done for you via a single click if you're the GM.

### Compatibility:
- Tested with FVTT v0.6.0.

### Known Issues:
- Currently can't get back to original prices, especially if percentage is set to 0.
- If a player has the sheet open when the GM changes the loot type, the player gets an error from FoundryVTT and must reload. This happens only the first time the type is changed.
- When a player has 2 items and give 1 to somebody, the sheet doesn't get updated and still show (2).
